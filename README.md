# Cheap_dynamic_shadow_WIP

##### This is a simple dynamic shadow shader made for the project intend to run on low efficient machines, more precisely for Smartphone devices. In fact, Implementing dynamic shadows on smartphone projects really a nightmare, I would not possible for now per say. while I thought using a decal system would be the right idea to deploy dynamic shadows on such projects. In addition, I have used a simple function to blur the diffuse shadow texture. Idea is quite simple I have started with it recently, no more perplexed function or expensive calculations. I look forward to get more ideas.


#### For using Shadow_projection function required the Unreal Engine 4.26.0 or higher versions.
