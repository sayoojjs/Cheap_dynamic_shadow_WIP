# Cheap_dynamic_shadow_WIP

### This is a simple dynamic shadow shader made for the project intend to run on low effient machines, more preciesly for Smartphone devices. Infact, Implementing dynamic shadows really on smartphone projects really a nightmire, while i though using decal system would be right idea to diploy dyamic shadows on such projects. In addition, I have used a simple function to blur the diffuse shadow texture. The idea quite simple, no more perplexed function or expensive calculation. I look forward to get more ideas :)
