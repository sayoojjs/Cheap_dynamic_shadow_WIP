# Cheap_dynamic_shadow_WIP

#### This is a simple dynamic shadow shader made for the project intend to run on low effient machines, more preciesly for Smartphone devices. Infact, Implementing dynamic shadows  on smartphone projects really a nightmare, while i thought using decal system would be right idea to deploy dyamic shadows on such projects. In addition, I have used a simple function to blur the diffuse shadow texture. The idea quite simple, no more perplexed function or expensive calculation. I look forward to get more ideas :)
